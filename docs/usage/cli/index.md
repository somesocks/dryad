# CLI

All commands in the `dryad` cli tool follow the same convention:
`dryad <RESOURCE> <ACTION> <ARGUMENTS>`.  Running `dryad` without any arguments prints help text and a list of commands.

NOTE: Commands may be added or changed frequently during development, so this list may not be up to date.
