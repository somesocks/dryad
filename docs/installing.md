# Installing

Binary releases are provided on the Github Releases page.

[Releases](https://github.com/somesocks/dryad/releases)

dryad is distributed as a single binary, so you only need to download the right version for your system and place in the environment path.

## Bash Autocompletion

For shells that support Bash-style tab auto-completion, a helper script is provided in releases to enable auto-completion for dryad commands and arguments. To enable it, download the bash auto-completion script and place it in your auto-completion config directory (for example, `/etc/bash_completion.d/`)
